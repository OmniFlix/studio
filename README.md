# OmniFlix Studio

## About
OmniFlix Studio aims to be the single destination to _mint, manage, distribute & monetize (list/auction)_ NFTs and community interactions. OmniFlix is building the infrastructure required for interchain NFT operations and users can benefit a lot with the infrastructure.

Eventually, users can run auctions, fractionalize, pool NFTs into content pools, move them across to Ethereum/CosmWasm chains & a lot more. The app, OmniFlix Studio, is currently not open-sourced yet, but parts of it will be in the near future.

## What's possible?
With OmniFlix Studio, a user can right now:

1) `create a denom/collection` - a _collection_ on the OmniFlix Hub is required to be able to mint NFTs into each of them. There's currently a requirement to mint a collection before you can mint NFTs. Collections play a larger role in the architecture of `oNFTs` (the NFT standard used on the OmniFlix Hub).

2) `mint an NFT` - upload a media file and create an NFT. This media file is stored in the OmniFlix IPFS cluster (which is being managed by OmniFlix first and will progressively decentralize)

3) `transfer` - an NFT that is minted with the `transferability` as `true` can be transferred or listed on the marketplace. This gives developers and users access to a new primitive of `non-transferable NFTs` which used for tickets, access passes, short-term certificates, etc. are valuable to prevent secondary markets and more.

4) `burn` - NFTs can be _deleted_ from the blockchain or `burnt` to ensure that the reference doesn't exist on the (block)chain. This allows creators to experiment with NFTs on a testnet, burn and eventually mint them on the mainnet or more. An NFT minted by `user1` when sold to `user2`, can NOT be burnt by `user1`. Only (current) owners of an NFT can burn the `NFT`.

5) `list` - NFTs that are minted can be listed on the protocol's marketplace for sale in the native FLIX token or a supported IBC token (like ATOM, OSMO, JUNO, etc.)

6) `delist` - NFTs that are listed can be de-listed to remove them from the marketplace. De-list is also a transaction on the blockchain and like listing, it costs a specific fee, most likely in the accepted tokens/denoms.
